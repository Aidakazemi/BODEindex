# BODEindex

R package for the BODE (body-mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and excercise capacity index) index: predicts the risk of death from any and respiratory causes in COPD patients described in [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa021322](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa021322).

## Installation

The latest stable version can be downloaded from CRAN:  
`install.packages ('BODEindex')`

Alternatively, you can download the latest development version from GitHub:

```
install.packages("BODEindex")
devtools::install_github("resplab/BODEindex")
```

# Web App for BODEindex 

BODEindex is also available as web app, accessible at [http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/BODEindex](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/BODEindex)

# BODE Index

To get BODE index, you will need to pass in patient's risk factors. For example: 

```
BODEindex (FEV1 = 40, mMRC = 3, BMI = 22, walk = 100)
```

The ***BODEindex()*** function returns score with possible values range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of death from any and respiratory causes in COPD patients.

## Cloud-based API Access
The [PRISM platform](http://prism.resp.core.ubc.ca) allows users to access BODEindex through the cloud. A MACRO-enabled Excel-file can be used to interact with the model and see the results. To download the PRISM Excel template file for BODEindex please refer to the [PRISM model repository](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/prism).
