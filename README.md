## bode

R package for the BODE (body-mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and excercise capacity index) index: predicts the risk of death from any and respiratory causes in COPD patients described in [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa021322](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa021322).

### Installation

You can download the latest development version from GitHub:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("resplab/BODEindex")
```


### BODE Index

To get BODE index, you will need to pass in patient's risk factors. For example: 

```
bode (FEV1 = 40, mMRC = 3, BMI = 22, walk = 100)
```

The ***BODEindex()*** function returns score with possible values range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of death from any and respiratory causes in COPD patients.

### Cloud-based API Access
The [PRISM platform](http://prism.resp.core.ubc.ca) allows users to access BODEindex through the cloud. A MACRO-enabled Excel-file can be used to interact with the model and see the results. To download the PRISM Excel template file for BODEindex please refer to the [PRISM model repository](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/prism).

#### Linux

In Ubuntu, you can call the API with `curl`:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"api_key":["123456"],"func":["prism_model_run"],"model_input":[{"FEV1": 40,"mMRC": 3,"BMI": 22,"walk": 100}]}' http://bode.cp.prism-ubc.linaralabs.com/ocpu/library/bodePrism/R/gateway/json
```

#### Windows

In Windows PowerShell, you can use `curl` to access the API:

```
curl -Body '{"api_key":["123456"],"func":["prism_model_run"],"model_input":[{"FEV1": 40,"mMRC": 3,"BMI": 22,"walk": 100}]}' -Method POST -uri http://bode.cp.prism-ubc.linaralabs.com/ocpu/library/bodePrism/R/gateway/json -Headers @{"Content-type"="application/json"}
```
